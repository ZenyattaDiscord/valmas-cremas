# valmas-cremas Website (WIP)

 I took on this project at the beginning of February to assist an alcohol distributing company in revamping their site. 
The original site was not very responsive for mobile, and was very clunky with the wrapping of assets. 

#Current bugs 
  -current url doesn't open to the homepage, click 'home' in the nav
  - currently working on the other pages, some will be empty or render the homepage
  -not currently built for mobile. This will be fixed 
The link to the current version is here https://zenyattadiscord.github.io/valmas-cremas
